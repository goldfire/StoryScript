EXT. SAMPLE SCENE - DAY 1 - AFTERNOON - CALM
Jack then yells to the two Men heâ€™s with to take the Tourniquet Man to safety -- and Jack RUNS -- OVER THE WING, 18 BEHIND THE MONSTROUS REVVING ENGINE -- 18 over to the Australian Pregnant Woman (CLAIRE) -- he helps her up -- helps her walk -- but she stumbles again, strains:

CLAIRE
(scared)
Iâ€™m having contractions--

JACK
Thatâ€™s not ideal...
(beat)
How far apart are they?

/* This is a basic conditional example. */

**{TestFact}**

CLAIRE
I donâ€™t know, a few of â€˜em just happened.

**{}**

JACK
How many months pregnant are you?

JACK (IDLE)
We could end up out here a while.

/* This is a simple comment that might be used to explain the choice below.. */

**= 1. Choice #1**
*{SampleScene_Choice01_01}*
**= 2. Choice #2**
*{SampleScene_Choice01_02}*
**= 3. Choice #3**
*{SampleScene_Choice01_03}*
**= 4. [silence]**
*{SampleScene_Choice01_Silence}*

**{SampleScene_Choice01_01}**

CLAIRE
Almost eight months.

JACK
Listen to me. Listen to me, youâ€™re gonna be okay... do you understand? But you need to lie absolutely (still)--

**{}**

**{SampleScene_Choice01_02}**

CLAIRE
That seems sort of personal!

JACK
Listen to me! Nowâ€™s not the time. Youâ€™ll be okay... just, you need to lie (still)--

**{}**

**{SampleScene_Choice01_03}**

CLAIRE
Whatâ€™s that matter now?

JACK
Youâ€™re going to be fine... do you understand? We just need to get you out (of)--

**{}**

**{SampleScene_Choice01_Silence}**

JACK
Youâ€™re going to be fine, I just need you to listen now. Just stay (still)--

**{}**

CLAIRE
(wincing in pain)
There... God, thatâ€™s a big one!

/* Getting more complex, a nested choice block. */

**{OPEN SampleScene_Choice01_Silence}**

JACK
(looks up, calls out)
YOU! COME HERE!

JACK (O.S.) (IDLE)
I need you to get this woman away from these fumes!

  **= 1. Another Choice #1**
  *{SampleScene_Choice02_01}*
  **= 2. Another Choice #2**
  *{SampleScene_Choice02_02}*
  **{TestFactForChoice}**
    **= 3. Another Choice #3**
    *{SampleScene_Choice02_03}*
  **{}**
  **= 4. Another Choice #4**
  *{SampleScene_Choice02_04}*
  **= 5. [silence]**
  *{SampleScene_Choice02_Silence}*

  **{SampleScene_Choice02_01}**

And Hurley does -- in this moment he might just follow anyone anywhere -- Jack rips off his watch, gives it to him:

HURLEY
Okay-- Okay--

JACK
Iâ€™ll be back soon.

  **{}**

  **{SampleScene_Choice02_02}**

HURLEY
You gotta be kidding me--

JACK
Take her over there! Then, stay with her! Donâ€™t let her move!

  **{}**

  **{SampleScene_Choice02_03}**

HURLEY
Hey, whatâ€™s your name?!

JACK
Look, if her contractions occur closer than three minutes apart, call out for me!
(beat)
Jack!

  **{}**

  **{SampleScene_Choice02_Silence}**

JACK
I need your help! Stay here with her and Iâ€™ll be back!

  **{}**

**{}**

This is some more test action descriptions. Next are some more complex compound/nested conditional blocks.

**{TestFact = 3 AND SampleScene_Choice01_03}**

JACK
Stop-- her headâ€™s not tilted far back enough-- youâ€™re blowing air into her stomach--

  **{TestFact02 AND NOT SampleScene_Choice01_01}**

BOONE
Are you sure? Iâ€™m a lifeguard! Iâ€™m licensed!

  **{}**

**{}**

**{TestFact OR SampleScene_Choice01_03}**

JACK
You seriously need to think about giving back that license...

**{}**

**{TestFact >= 1 AND SampleScene_Choice01_03 OR TestFact2}**

BOONE
Thatâ€™s exactly what I was doing!

**{}**

/*

This is a multi-line comment.

Just to see if we can trip it up! ðŸ‘º

*/

**{BARK BarkFact AND BarkFact2}**

BOONE (O.S.)
Hey man, sheâ€™s still not breathing!
(beat)
Maybe we need to do one of those hole things-- where you stick a pen in her throat?

**{}**

**{OPEN OpenFact}**

JACK
Yeah, good idea-- you go get me a pen!

  **{ObjectInInventory}**

JACK
Oh-- here!

  **{}**
